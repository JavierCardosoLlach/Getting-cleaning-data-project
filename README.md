## Getting and cleaning data: Project

The run_analysis.R script enclosed in this repository processes the Galaxy Smartphone dataset referenced in the Acknowledgements section. The script follows the same order outlined in the project description:

#####0. Downloaded and unzipped the files 

#####1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set:
The training and the test dataset have the same configuration. There are three files in each directory:
- measurements: 561 float variables
- subject ID: single column, an integer from 1 to 30
- activity info: single column an integer from 1 to 6

Since both the training and test sites have the same variables, the script appends the "train" set to the "test" set to each one of the 3 datasets described above. After that, the 3 dataframes are combined by adding the subject and activity info as new columns to the measurement data. The resulting dataframe is named mergedData.

#####2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
Using the features.txt file from the dataset, the script identifies  all the measurements that correspond to either mean or standard deviation from the data and subset the relevant columns into a new dataframe named mergedData2. 

This is done by looking for the strings "mean()", "std()","meanFreq", and "Mean" in the features dataframe. According to the features_info.rxt file, these variables correspond to the mean or standard deviation for each measurement.

#####3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
The MergedData2 dataframe identifies the activity with an integer from 1 to 6. The activity_labels.txt file contains descriptive activity names for them. The scripts merges the activity labels to MergedData2 based on the activity id (the integer from 1 to 6). The new dataframe is named mergedData3. 

#####4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
To keep consistency with the main dataset all the variables keep the same name from the original dataset. The script uses the variable names from the features.txt file.  Those names describe each one of the variables. Additionally, they are documented in the features_info.txt file provided in the dataset.

#####5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Using the dplyr package the script groups and summarizes the data into a final dataframe named "tidydataset". This file is then saved as a text file using the write.table function.
